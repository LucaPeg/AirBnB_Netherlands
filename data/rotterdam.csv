Sinds 2015 ben ik trotse eigenares van dit stadsappartement op de perfecte locatie!
Met mijn partner en baby samen ga ik binnenkort verhuizen naar een buitenwijk van Rotterdam omdat dit mooie stadsappartement gewoonweg te klein is om met z'n 3en in te blijven wonen.
Omdat ik in het verleden jarenlang dit appartement heb verhuurd via o.a. Airbnb, wil ik dat nu opnieuw doen voor een tijdje.
Dit keer is mijn gehele appartement beschikbaar via Airbnb, voorheen woonde ik er zelf ook en tegelijkertijd verhuurde ik een kamer voor 2 personen.

Ik woon, werk en studeer(de) in Rotterdam.
Sinds 2015 werk ik als zelfstandig Recruiter, Relatiemanager en Sollicitatiecoach.
Wat ik erg leuk vind aan mijn werk is het dagelijks schakelen met een diversiteit aan mensen en nationaliteiten op verschillende niveaus.

Naast dat er veel tijd gaat naar mijn lieve baby (dreumes alweer), besteed ik graag tijd aan surfen, mijn familie en vrienden, muziek volleybal, hardlopen en nieuwe plekken ontdekken.
Mijn favoriete muziek is Reggae; ik kan geen dag zonder!

Voor mij is deze plek de ideale plek van wonen; midden in het centrum, alles op loop- en fietsafstand. Ik ervaar hier het ultieme stadsgevoel met nog een beetje groen om mij heen!

Naast mijn benb vind ik het heerlijk om in mijn tuin te tuinieren.  Ik schilder graag en maak tassen. 
Ik help anderen hun huis te reorganiseren en opknappen.
Dus u zou mij in kluskleding aan kunnen treffen ;-)

Sinds kort bezit ik een camperbusje. Ik ben daar erg blij mee en ga graag naar natuulijke campings waar het vaak mooi, rustig en vriendelijk is. Bovendien is daar qua natuur veel te beleven.

I am Saskia, single, lawyer. I have been living and working in Rotterdam for about 30 years. In July 2015 I bought the apartment in the Timmerhuis (casco), and I moved in at the end of 2015. 
I live there with a lot of pleasure! The location is fantastic, I have very nice neighbors and the apartment itself has everything I could want. But the terraces are my pride and joy, and also the main reason for buying the apartment. I have what you call in Dutch ""green fingers.""

Because of a major leak, which fortunately has now been fixed, I was unable to accept bookings for a year.  This was followed by the Covid pandemic. 

I look forward to hearing your experiences!

The motivational factor is ofcourse the money but in the end this should hopefully not be a merely financial transaction.

Welcome at my page!:)
My name is Mirjam, I'm a Dutchie, in daily life I'm a social worker. In my spare time I love to visit new places, nature, singing, a sucker for good coffee,  going out for walks,  try to play guitar ( with the emphasis on 'try'), do my best to give some love to my plants, like to cook and ofcourse... traveling!

Since I was young I already liked traveling.  I remember my family and I were traveling by campervan. Such a joy we had. I continued traveling when I got older. I've been to countries within Europe, but also outside Europe, like: the US, Indonesia, South Africa, Brazil, Curacaõ, Laoh and Thailand.  I've stayed more than a year in Thailand where I've worked on voluntary base as a counselor. 

When I travel I would like to have that feeling of 'home'. That's why I  love to host and to give my guests that feeling of 'home' as well. 

That feeling of traveling and meeting new people, makes me come alive. 
So why not meeting new people, travelers, in my city Rotterdam?

I hope to get to know you a bit as well:)

I am Joost, I live in Rotterdam and I love to travel and explore the world for work as for pleasure. That's why I can sometimes rent out my cosy apartment in the centre of Rotterdam. Throughout my travelling career I have always used Rotterdam as my base. This is the city where I grew up, studied and most of my family & friends live whom I meet up with for dinner & drinks in the weekend. I hope you will enjoy Rotterdam as much I do. The city has a great vibe with lots of contemporary architectonical buildings and cool bars. In the street of my apartment are many bars and restaurants to be found. I hope you will enjoy yourself. 

Cheers,
Joost

I am a passionate traveler and Airbnb guest/superhost, having been in the industry for years. I understand the importance of a great experience for both myself and my hosts and strive to make my stays as comfortable, clean, and accurate as possible. Originally from the Netherlands, I have lived in several countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, South Africa, the United States, and Argentina, and now call Copenhagen, Denmark my home. 

When it comes to travel, I love to experience different cultures and local lifestyles, and I truly appreciate the conversations and interactions I get to have with hosts and other guests. I am not very needy, but I do expect the accommodation to be as described. In my free time, I enjoy photography, scuba diving, aviation and cultural visits.

Since I can remember I always had a passion for travel. In my past I traveled around the world for 10 months and loved it. For me accommodation must feel like a new home. Opening the door should give me an “aaah wow” moment. I’ve seen a lot of hotels/hostels and other kind of accommodation during those 10 months. This apartment is my home at the moment. I love arriving home and fall on the couch. I also love cooking and discovering my own city (and country). I like to read on my balcony with a cold drink in my hand.
